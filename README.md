## Background 
 
We used the [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the Cleveland Database. This database contains clinical and bio-medical attributes for more than 300 patients. The "goal" field refers to the presence of a heart disease in a patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.   

## Week 1 

We have performed exploratory data analysis on the Cleveland heart disease dataset described above, and trained machine learning models to diagnose heart disease based on the available data and compare them visually in a grouped bar chart with regard to accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, along with confusion matrix for each classifier in python, and R.
